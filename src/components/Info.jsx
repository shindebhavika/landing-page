            Uranus, the ruler of Aquarius, starts 2024 in retrograde, going
            direct on Saturday, January 27, then retrogrades again on Sunday,
            <br />
            September 1. This suggests ongoing evolution in your home life and
            personal growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Uranus champions individuality, social justice, and authenticity.
            During its retrograde, focus on living by your values and perhaps
            engage
            <br /> more actively in humanitarian efforts.

            In 2024, the location of the Sun on the March equinox is in the
            constellation of Pisces but also on the border of Aquarius. <br />{" "}
            So, we are slowly moving into a new age, from Pisces to Aquarius.

            Aquarius is ruled by Uranus, the planet that governs innovation,
            technology, and surprising events. Uranus perfectly mirrors
            Aquarius' <br /> distinctive attitude, complementing the
            nontraditional nature of these visionary air signs.
